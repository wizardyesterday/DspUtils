I wrote all of this code when studying the Proakis and Manolakis digital
signal processing book (second edition).  I just decided to immortalize my
code.  You can use it, laugh at it, or just blah.  Based upon the .mak files,
I believe I built this on a Windows system, but I have also compiled and
built the code on a Linux system too.

Enjoy!
